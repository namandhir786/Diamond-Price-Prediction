# Diamond Price Prediction

Welcome to the **Diamond Price Prediction** project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of diamonds based on various features. Leveraging a robust dataset and advanced ML techniques, the system provides insights into the factors that influence diamond prices and helps in making data-driven pricing decisions.

## Project Overview

Diamonds are one of the most precious and sought-after gemstones. Pricing diamonds accurately is essential for buyers, sellers, and jewelers. This project uses machine learning to predict diamond prices based on specific features such as carat, cut, clarity, color, and dimensions. The goal is to create a model that not only predicts prices but also highlights the significance of different features in pricing decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains **190,000 diamond entries**. The dataset includes the following features:

- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond.
- **Cut**: Quality of the diamond's cut (e.g., Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- **Color**: Diamond color grade (ranging from D to J, with D being the best).
- **Clarity**: Measure of diamond inclusions (e.g., IF, VVS1, VVS2, SI1, SI2, etc.).
- **Depth**: Total depth percentage (z / average(x, y)).
- **Table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point.
- **Dimensions (x, y, z)**: Length, width, and depth of the diamond in millimeters.
- **Price**: The target variable, representing the price of the diamond.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and libraries are utilized in this project:

- **Python**: Programming language for building the solution.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting graphs and charts.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development and evaluation.
- **Flask**: Web framework for deploying the machine learning model as an API.
- **Logging**: For debugging and tracking application behavior.

## Features of the Project

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Performed in-depth analysis of the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
   - Visualized the relationships between features and their impact on price.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., cut, color, and clarity).
   - Normalized numerical features to improve model performance.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Built and trained regression models using scikit-learn.
   - Compared the performance of different models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Tuned hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deployed the trained model using Flask.
   - Provided an interactive interface for users to input diamond features and obtain price predictions.

## Key Insights

- **Carat** has the most significant impact on diamond prices.
- **Cut, color, and clarity** also play a crucial role in determining the value of a diamond.
- Dimensions (x, y, z) and proportions (depth, table) further influence pricing but to a lesser extent.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Diamond-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Diamond-Price-Prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## Usage

- Input the details of a diamond (carat, cut, color, clarity, dimensions, etc.) through the web interface.
- The application will predict the price of the diamond and display the result.

## Results

The model achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting diamond prices. The following metrics were used to evaluate performance:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²) Score**

## Future Scope

- Improve model accuracy by incorporating advanced techniques such as ensemble learning.
- Integrate more features, such as diamond certification grades (e.g., GIA, AGS).
- Build a user-friendly dashboard for visualization and interaction.
- Deploy the model as a cloud-based service for wider accessibility.
